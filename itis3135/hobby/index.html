            <p>Soccer is a simple yet captivating game. The objective is to score more goals than the opposing team by

            <p>Each team consists of 11 players on the field, including a goalkeeper who is responsible for preventing
                the ball from entering their team's goal.</p>
            <p>Players advance the ball up the field by dribbling, passing, and ultimately attempting to score. Fouls,
                such as tripping or pushing, result in penalties or free kicks for the opposing team.</p>
